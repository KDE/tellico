To regenerate the message strings, type

make package-messages

from the top-level directory.

Please note that you need a special for KDE patched version of xgettext. You
can obtain it from http://packages.ubuntu.com/de/edgy/gettext-kde. Don't forget
to make this binary available as xgettext (instead of kde-xgettext) by e.g.
creating a link in your search path.

If you don't do this, code such as i18n("Comic Book Illustrator", "Artist")
would correspond to two separate strings "Comic Book Illustrator" and
"Artist" instead of a combined entry from which only the second one has to be
translated:

msgid ""
"_: Comic Book Illustrator\n"
"Artist"
msgstr "KÃ¼nstler"

You also need the tool extractrc. In Debian it is available in the package
kdesdk-scripts.
