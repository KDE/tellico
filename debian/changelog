tellico (1.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * "New" upstream release, aimed at Etch. Differences with 1.2.4-1 are :
    + Build fix for OOo plugin (disabled in the package anyway), r1206
    + Check if pointer is NULL *before* using it, r1212.
    + Some minor build issues
    + Use log messages instead of debug
  * Also backport a bunch of bugfixes :
    + r1216 : fix crashing bug in progressitem.
    + r1224 : clear release list when removing an image.
    + r1228 : prevent an infinite loop.
    + r1245 & r1248 : fix a race condition leading to loss of images.
    + r1265 : sometimes images wouldn't show up if the cover column was
      visible in the list view.
    + r1340 : sometimes z39.50 results would not show up.
    + All this makes the package back in good shape for Etch (Closes: #411744).
  * Many thanks to Robby Stephenson, the uptream author, for his help picking
    the patches for inclusion.
  * Only call dh_compress once so help files are not compressed and can be read
    (Closes: #401247).

 -- Regis Boudin <regis@boudin.name>  Tue, 20 Feb 2007 18:27:45 +0000

tellico (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. Now works with KDE 3.3.1, so I can provide Sarge
    backports again. Thanks Robby for caring about that. (Closes: #396508).
    This package actually includes patches from the 1.2.x branch, up top
    r1203, which contains several bugfixes.
  * Have tellico-data depend on kdelibs-data, so we don't have broken symlinks.
    (Closes: #387795). Thanks Lars Wirzenius for pointing at it.
  * All the official arch have at least kdepim 3.5.5, drop build-dep on
    kdepim-dev.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2.2

 -- Regis Boudin <regis@boudin.name>  Thu,  2 Nov 2006 20:32:48 +0000

tellico (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

    (Closes: #380014)
  * Suggest python and python2.4 for the external scripts.
  * Drop remove_zlib_link.diff patch. xml2-config and xslt-config
    return only the necessary flags now.
  * libkcal2-dev now contains libemailfunctions/idmapper.h, so no need to
    build-depend on the whole kdepim-dev anymore. Thanks Christopher Martin
    for applying the patch. Build-depend on
    libkcal2-dev( >= 3.5.4-1) | kdepim-dev, so the package can build with
    older versions of kdepim.

  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.7.2. No other change.

  * The "transitions-clean" release.

    management. Also have a proper apply-patches target in debian/rules
  * am_maintainer_mode.diff : use maintainer mode, see previous changelog
    entries.
  * libtool_for_libyaz.diff : dirty hack using "-lyaz" instead of what
    yaz-config returns. This lets libtool deal with linking and removes bogus
    dependencies on libssl and libwrap.
  * remove_QT_links.diff : more hack to avoid QT forcing us to link against
    X libraries and libpng, which we don't use directly.
  * remove_zlib_link.diff : same hack as for libyaz with libxml2 and libxslt
    to get rid of zlib1g dependency.
