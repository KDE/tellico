Basic instructions for compiling Tellico
========================================

Also found at http://userbase.kde.org/Tellico/Compiling

These instructions use Tellico  2.0 as  an example. For
other versions, replace 2.0 in the commands below.

-------------------------------------------------------

Source Package
=============

If you download the source package, extract all of the
files, which should create a directory named tellico-2.0/.

% tar xjvf tellico-2.0.tar.bz2
% cd tellico-2.0

After that, there are three steps to build and install Tellico.

Configure
=========

The compilation environment must be configured to your
system first. The tool used to create the configuration
is CMake. CMake will check that you have all the
required development libraries and set up the file
for compiling.

In the tellico-2.0/ directory, create a directory fo
building, named build/, just to keep things clear.

% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix`

Note the backquotes in the cmake command, they are important.

The .. tells CMake to use the top-level tellico-2.0/
directory as the source directory, and to set the
application to install in the same place as other
KDE applications. Later, when you install Tellico,
you will likely need root access, either through
the root password or sudo.

If you do not have the necessary libraries for
building tellico, CMake will fail and show you
an error, listing which libraries you lack. Some
libraries are required for building. Some are
optional for additional functionality. The library
packages may have different names, depending on your
distribution.

Compile
=======

Make is used to actually compile Tellico.

% make

There will likely be some warnings during compilation,
but if you see something like

[100%] Built target tellico

then the compilation completed successfully.

Install
=======

To install Tellico alongside other KDE applications,
you will likely need to use the sudo command.

% sudo make install

Enter your password, and Tellico should be installed
and should show up in the KDE menu, likely in the
Office menu. Or, run it from the command-line.

% tellico

You can send questions to the tellico-users mailing list.

If you need to uninstall Tellico

% sudo make uninstall
