Basic instructions for compiling Tellico
========================================

Also found at http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Tellico/Compiling

These instructions use Tellico 4.0 as an example. For
other versions, replace 4.0 in the commands below.

-------------------------------------------------------

Source Package
=============

If you download the source package, extract all of the
files, which should create a directory named tellico-4.0/.

% tar xJvf tellico-4.0.tar.xz
% cd tellico-4.0

After that, there are three steps to build and install Tellico.

Configure
=========

The compilation environment must be configured to your
system first. The tool used to create the configuration
is CMake. CMake will check that you have all the
required development libraries and set up the file
for compiling.

In the tellico-4.0/ directory, create a directory for
building, named build/, just to keep things clear.

% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..

The .. tells CMake to use the top-level tellico-4.0/
directory as the source directory. Later, when you install
Tellico, you will likely need root access, either through
the root password or sudo. To install to a different
location, use the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option.

If you do not have the necessary libraries for
building tellico, CMake will fail and show you
an error, listing which libraries you lack. Some
libraries are required for building. Some are
optional for additional functionality. The library
packages may have different names, depending on your
distribution.

Options
-------
In order to include support for using a webcam to
scan barcodes, you must have the libv4l library installed
and include -DENABLE_WEBCAM=true when you run cmake.

To include support for debugging Tellico, you should
pass the -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug option to cmake.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release is for stripped, non-debugging
compilation.

Tellico has many unit tests for checking some parts of
the code for problems. The tests can be compiled by
using -DBUILD_TESTING=TRUE and then running

% make test

Compile
=======

Make is used to actually compile Tellico.

% make

There will likely be some warnings during compilation,
but if you see something like

[100%] Built target tellico

then the compilation completed successfully.

Install
=======

To install Tellico alongside other KDE applications,
you will likely need to use the sudo command.

% sudo make install

Enter your password, and Tellico should be installed
and should show up in the KDE menu, likely in the
Office menu. Or, run it from the command-line.

% tellico

You can send questions to the tellico-users mailing list.

If you need to uninstall Tellico

% sudo make uninstall
