This directory contains a minimal version of the btparse library,
copyright 1999 by Greg Ward, which can be found at
          <url:http://www.gerg.ca/software/btOOL/>
Version 0.33 of the btparse library was imported into the Bookcase 
source code tree in October 2003. The following changes have been
made:

- All non-source code files were removed.
- The c++ reserved word 'class' was changed to 'errclass'.
- The files bt_config.h and my_dmalloc.h were removed, along with all
  references to them. Some of the definitions in bt_config.h were
  moved to btparse.h.
- Some included files were changed in ast.c.
