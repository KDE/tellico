<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label each chapter
so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it allows
you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files
will vary from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers
and for the CVS system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left
out at the author's discretion. Other chapters should not be left out
in order to maintain a consistent documentation style across all KDE
apps. -->

<sect1 id="tellico-intro">
<title>&appname;</title>

<para>
&appname; is a program for managing collections. It began as a simple
book collection manager, and has expanded to include default
collection templates for bibliographies, comic books, videos, music,
coins, stamps, trading cards, video games, wines, board games, and file listings.
In addition, custom collections can be built for any other type of collectibles.
</para>

<sect2 id="what-tellico-is">
<title>What &appname; Is</title>

<para>
&appname; keeps track of the items in a collection, and offers
an easy way to enter data for each entry. It provides several
field types, and allows for an unlimited number of
user-defined fields. The entries in a collection may be grouped by any
field for easy organization, and customizable views show as much or as
little information as you like.
</para>

<para>
Loans may be tracked, with optional integration with &korganizer;. Collections may be
imported or exported using a variety of formats, to allow for easy exchange
or publication of data.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="what-tellico-is-not">
<title>What &appname; Is Not</title>

<para>
&appname; is not an audio or video player. It does not provide
facilities for reading or modifying multimedia files. It also does
not provide any image-editing functionality. Although &appname; has some
functionality for managing bibliography lists, it is not a full-blown
bibliographic reference manager. &appname; also does not pretend to have
all the capabilities of a full-fledged relational database.
</para>

<para>
As somewhat of a disclaimer, &appname; is a hobby for the author, and no
guarantees are made about its functionality, usefullness, or otherwise.
More information is included in the
<link linkend="credits">license declaration</link>.

<sect1 id="terminology">
<title>Terminology</title>

<sect2 id="collections">
<title>Collections</title>
<para>
In &appname;, a collection is the document. Only one collection exists in each &appname;
file. A collection contains any number of <link linkend="fields">fields</link> and
<link linkend="entries">entries</link>. &appname; supports 12 specific collection types by
default: books, bibliographic entries, comic books, videos, music, trading cards, coins, stamps,
video games, wines, board games, and file listings. In addition, an empty generic collection
template is available for any other type of collectibles or lists.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="fields">
<title>Collection Fields</title>
<para>
Each collection may have an unlimited number of fields. &appname; supports eleven types of fields,
which allow for a range of different data. The fields can be edited with the
<link linkend="fields-dialog"><interface>Collection Fields Dialog</interface></link> and are explained further in the
<link linkend="field-types">Field Types</link> section.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2 id="entries">
<title>Collection Entries</title>

<para>
An entry is the basic record in &appname;. Each entry contains a single value for each field in
the collection. A collection may have an unlimited number of entries, in theory, although since
the whole collection is always resident in memory, too many entries could slow down the application.
</para>

<para>
&appname; has been tested with a collection of 10,000 entries, and the speed was satisfactory.
However, if many large images are included in the collection, the loading and processing time
does slow down greatly. Performance can be improved by having &appname; store images separate from
the data file itself, either in the application-specific folder or a folder relative to
the data file. More information can be found in the
<link linkend="configuration">configuration section</link>.
