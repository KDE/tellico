<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label
each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files will vary
from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

<chapter id="introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>

<!-- The introduction chapter contains a brief introduction for the
application that explains what it does and where to report
problems. Basically a long version of the abstract.  Don't include a
revision history. (see installation appendix comment) -->

<title>Developer's Guide to Bookcase</title>

<!-- (OPTIONAL) A Programming/Scripting reference chapter should be
used for apps that use plugins or that provide their own scripting hooks
and/or development libraries. -->

<para>
Programming &bookcase; plugins is a joy to behold. Just read through the next
66 pages of API's to learn how!

<!-- Use refentries to describe APIs.  Refentries are fairly complicated and you
should consult the docbook reference for further details. The example below was
taken from that reference and shortened a bit for readability. -->

(and not-so-silly) newbie questions that fill up your mailbox. This chapter
should be reserved for BRIEF questions and answers! If one question uses more
than a page or so then it should probably be part of the
"Using this Application" chapter instead. You should use links to
cross-reference questions to the parts of your documentation that answer them.
This is also a great place to provide pointers to other FAQ's if your users
must do some complicated configuration on other programs in order for your
application work. -->

.Libraries or other software that is not included in kdesupport,
kdelibs, or kdebase.
.Hardware requirements like amount of RAM, disk space, graphics card
capabilities, screen resolution, special expansion cards, etc.
.Operating systems the app will run on. If your app is designed only for a
specific OS, (you wrote a graphical LILO configurator for example) put this
information here.

In order to successfully use &bookcase;, you need KDE 3.x. &bookcase; uses about 5 megs of
memory to run, but this may vary depending on your platform and
configuration.
