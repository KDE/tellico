<title>Configuration</title>


<para>
The <interface>Configuration Dialog</interface> contains all the options for
changing some of the default behaviour of &appname;.
</para>

<para>
Clicking the <guibutton>Apply</guibutton> button <action>causes the changes to
take effect immediately</action> without closing the dialog, while
<guibutton>OK</guibutton> <action>applies the changes and closes the dialog</action>. <guibutton>Cancel</guibutton> closes the dialog, but any changes already made
and applied will remain. The <guibutton>Default</guibutton> button <action>reverts
the options</action> on the current page of the dialog to their default values,
while <guibutton>Help</guibutton> <action>opens the &khelpcenter;</action> to
the relative section of the &appname; manual.
</para>

<para>
Some minor settings can only be changed by editing the configuration file itself. See <link linkend="hidden-options">Hidden Options</link>.

<para>
The <guilabel>General Options</guilabel> control the general behavior. When &appname;
is started, it can automatically reopen the last data file that was open. The
<guilabel>Tip of the Day</guilabel> dialog contains helpful hints on using &appname;
and appears at program startup. You may want to read through some of the hints and
then disable the dialog. Finally, in the <link linkend="group-view">&group-view;</link>, the
number of entries in each group may be added to the group name.
</para>

<para>
The <guilabel>Formatting Options</guilabel> control the level of automatic formatting
that &appname; does. For examples, see the <link linkend="field-formatting">Field
Formatting section</link>. Capitalization and formatting are distinct options, since
a field may be capitalized without having the order of the words changed, and
vice-versa. The automatic formatting includes grammatical articles in titles,
along with prefixes and suffixes for personal names. The values are case-insensitive,
and should be separated by a semi-colon.
</para>

<para>
The formatting rules follow general English usage, which may not work for other languages.
Articles are appended to the end of the title, with a comma. Personal names are formatted
to have the last name first, followed by a comma, then the first name. Personal suffixes,
such as Jr., are kept with the last name. Prefixes, such as <emphasis>von</emphasis>,
are kept with the last name, but are ignored when the values are being sorted.</para>

<informalexample><para><emphasis>John Q. von Public, III</emphasis> would become
<emphasis>von Public, III, John Q.</emphasis> and <emphasis>Public</emphasis> would
be used as the sort key.</para></informalexample>

<para>
Only single word prefixes are supported. If a name includes <emphasis>van der</emphasis>,
for example, both <emphasis>van</emphasis> and <emphasis>der</emphasis> should be included
in the surname prefix list. Articles ending with an apostrophe are supported for sorting
order, as well.
</para>

<note><para>The actual values in the collection are <emphasis>not</emphasis> changed,
only the visible text used for the interface. So the formatting options can be
changed back and forth without affecting any of the data in the collection.</para></note>

<sect1 id="printing-options">
<title><guilabel>Printing Options</guilabel></title>

<para>
&appname; uses an &xslt; template for creating &html;
and then passes that to the &kde; printing service. Only the fields visible in the <link linkend="detailed-view">&detailed-view;</link> are printed. Furthermore, if the collection
is being filtered, only the visible entries will be printed. Initially, a warning message
is shown if filtering is active.

</screenshot>

<para>
The <guilabel>Printing Options</guilabel> allow you to change some formatting when
printing a collection. If <guilabel>Format titles and names</guilabel> is checked,
then the fields are <link linkend="field-formatting">auto-formatted</link> when they
are printed. Otherwise, they are printed exactly as they were entered.
</para>

<para>
The default printing stylesheet prints the collection with the field values in columns.
<guilabel>Print field headers</guilabel> controls whether the field title is printed
at the top of the column.
</para>

<para>
In the printout, the entries will be sorted as they are in the <link linkend="detailed-view">&detailed-view;</link>. However, they may be grouped as they
are in the <link linkend="group-view">&group-view;</link> instead, which can be changed
using the <guilabel>Group the entries</guilabel> option.
</para>

<para>
Finally, when image fields are included in the printout, the images may be resized,
while maintaining their aspect ratio. The maximum image width and height define the
largest possible size of the image, though it will never be increased.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1 id="template-options">
<title><guilabel>Template Options</guilabel></title>

<para>
The <link linkend="entry-view">&entry-view;</link> uses templates to show the field
values. You can specify a different template for each collection type. Some templates,
such as the <emphasis>Album</emphasis> or <emphasis>Video</emphasis> templates are
for a specific collection type, and a short error message will appear in the
&entry-view; when they are used for other types.
</para>

<para>
Additional templates may be installed in <filename class="directory">$<envar>KDEHOME</envar>/share/apps/tellico/entry-templates/</filename>.

<title><guilabel>Data Sources Options</guilabel></title>

<para>
&appname; can use various sources for importing data, which can be configured
in the Data Sources Dialog. Currently, there are three available types of sources:
<link linkend="amazon-web-services">Amazon.com Web Services</link>, the
<link linkend="imdb">Internet Movie Database</link>, and
<link linkend="z3950">z39.50 servers</link>.

New sources may be added by clicking the <guibutton>New...</guibutton> button, while
existing ones may be modified or deleted, using the <guibutton>Modify...</guibutton> or
<guibutton>Remove</guibutton> buttons.
</para>

<sect2 id="amazon-web-services">
<title>Amazon.com</title>

<para>
Using the Amazon Web Services, &appname; can search four different international sites operated by <ulink url="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</ulink> for information: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan.
Other local Amazon.com servers, such as <ulink url="http://amazon.fr">Amazon.fr</ulink> are expected to available
soon.
</para>

<screenshot>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="amazon-options.png"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
Configuring each Amazon.com source involves three settings: the server location, image size, and associate's ID. Some information
from <ulink url="http://amazon.com">Amazon.com</ulink> included an image, such as a book or video cover. That image may be downloaded in three different sizes, depending on the item. Because too many images slow the application, medium or large images are not recommended. The associate's ID must be used to access the Amazon.com Web Services, and is included in the links back to the item, as dictated by the license agreement for the use of the Amazon.com Web Services.
</para>

</sect2>

<sect2 id="imdb">
<title>Internet Movie Database</title>

<para>
The <ulink url="http://www.imdb.com">Internet Movie Database</ulink> provides information about movies and videos. When a search is conducted for a <emphasis>Person</emphasis>, if more than one possible result is returned, a dialog box is opened to allow you to select the correct person. The two configuration options include setting the web server address and whether images are grabbed or not.
</para>

<para>
Obviously, more than one Amazon.com provider from the same country, or more than one IMDb provider is superfluous.
</para>

<sect2 id="z3950">
<title>z39.50 Servers</title>

<para>
The <ulink url="http://www.cni.org/pub/NISO/docs/Z39.50-brochure/50.brochure.toc.html">z39.50 protocol</ulink> is used to access libraries and bibliographic information providers around the world. Lists of public z39.50 servers are <ulink url="http://www.indexdata.dk/targettest/">available from indexdata.dk</ulink>, among others. &appname; is able to access any z39.50 server that provides data in the <acronym>MARC</acronym>, <acronym>MARC21</acronym>, or <acronym>USMARC</acronym> format, using the <ulink url="http://www.indexdata.dk/yaz/">yaz library</ulink>.
</para>

<screenshot>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject><imagedata format="PNG" fileref="z3950-options.png"/></imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</screenshot>

<para>
The default port for z39.50 access is 210, but some servers may use a different one. &appname; assumes the server uses the Marc-8 character encoding, unless configured otherwise. If an incorrect character encoding is used, an error message may appear on the program output, or possibly no entries are retrieved.
</para>

<para>
Some servers require a username and password for access. &appname; can use and save that password, but be aware that is written to the &appname; configuration file in plain text and is not secure. For most public servers, the username and password fields may be left empty.
