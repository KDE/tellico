BCAttribute::formatTitle()
  If the user enters an article at the end of the title, like so: "new title, a" because
  he/she doesn't know that it gets switched automatically, it should get saved in the proper
  place at the beginning, and then the normal switch is made.

BCAttribute::formatName()
  Need to implement first name/last name sorting.

Bookcase::slotFileSave() or whatever
  Figure out how to include a graphic of the book cover or whatever. Should probably move to a
  KTarGz file format like koffice.
