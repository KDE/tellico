=== User Interface
* Replace most of the toggle actions in the view settings with KDualAction
* When adding new default value to a field, offer to insert value in existing entries
* Centralize all the optional fields inside CollectionManager so the names are ensured to stay consistent. Add UI for adding to collection outside of fetcher results.

* Allow regenerating of sequential entry ids
* Bulk find/replace in field values
* Allow user to show/hide fields in the edit dialog, such as when a music album has multiple track fields

=== Bugs
* Make sure all usages of FileRef* delete the pointer
* Use FileRef for template installation to support network install
